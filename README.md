# template for "Microsoft Lean 3" repo.

The toml in this project contains the last version of mathlib which was compatible with Microsoft Lean 3.4.2.

There is also a test file. This project is properly installed when you can restart Lean, get the test file
to compile in just a few seconds, and fill in the `sorry`.
